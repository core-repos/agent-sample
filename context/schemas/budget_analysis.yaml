  - "NO budget_id field exists - do not reference it"
  - "NO budget_name field exists - use tr_product instead"
  - "Use tr_product_id for product identification, not budget_id"
  - "All budget amounts are in USD and stored as FLOAT type"
  - "Fiscal year fields follow naming pattern: fy_XX_budget and fy26_XXX"

sample_queries:
  - "SELECT SUM(fy_26_budget) FROM budget_analysis"
  - "SELECT tr_product_id, tr_product, fy_26_budget FROM budget_analysis WHERE fy_26_budget > 1000000"
  - "SELECT cto, SUM(fy_26_budget) FROM budget_analysis GROUP BY cto"
